feat: Fritz!Box Voicemail Tool via Web Scraping

Switched from unreliable TR-064 attempts to a web scraping approach targeting the Fritz!Box web interface (Login via login_sid.lua, data retrieval via data.lua).

Implemented core features:
- List voicemails (`--list`) with filters (all, latest, index, known, unknown).
- Download single (`index`), latest (`latest`), or all (`all`) voicemails (`--download`).
- Support for various list output formats (`--format`: table, simple, json, csv).
- Data extraction using Regex (`awk`, `grep -P`) due to malformed HTML provided by the box, which caused standard parsers (pup, hxselect) to fail.
- Optional conversion of downloaded WAV files to OGG or MP3 using `ffmpeg` (controlled by file extension for `index/latest` or `--audio-format` parameter for `all`).
- Improved code structure (library `fb_lib.sh`, parser `_parse_voicemail_html.sh`, main script `fb-voicemailtools.sh`).
- Enhanced logging with debug output via `-v`/`--verbose`.
- Correct handling of Ctrl+C (SIGINT) with cleanup function (logout).
- Support for clean list output to file (`--output-file`) or via pipe/redirection.
- Various bug fixes related to index extraction, path construction (padding), and the `curl` command for downloads.
